Hail Kevin,
who had been crucified as one would have said ,3',
And who had been reborn as one would have said ,5',
And who had been born as one would have said ,2',
And who had been idolized as one would have thought as one would have had been crucified though had been reborn while had been born,
And talked as one would have had been idolized.
Amen.
